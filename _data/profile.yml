  <p>
  My research interests are in numerical optimization, 
  differential geometry, physics-based simulation in computer graphics and applying machine learning to solve their system, 
  including various simulations of deformable solids, fluids, and thermomechanical effects and, 
  non-linear/linear optimization for sparse matrix. I am looking for jobs in similar areas. Please contact me.
